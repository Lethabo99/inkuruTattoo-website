<h4><b>Tattoos in Azania</b></h4><table>
<tr><td>For many thousands of years, tattoos were seen as a way of curing disease, protecting against spirits, showing affiliation towards certain groups/tribes, and reflecting personality traits such as bravery, courage, and social status.

These tattoos were predictably very simple in design. They consisted of pairs of straight lines on the arms and legs of the priestess and also included an elliptical pattern beneath the navel (belly button) area.

The oldest tattoo every found was on an Egyptian mummy around 2000 BCE. Besides this discovery, many other mummified tattoo examples have been revealed and documented. One Egyptologist believes these tattoos could have symbolized and represented rejuvenation and fertility in women.

Although there has been a large presence of Islamic societies within North Africa throughout its history (who do not support the ideas of tattooing or otherwise engraving on the body), there were many who considered the art form of tattooing to be a legitimate practice - especially large groups of Moroccan women for reasons currently unknown.

Most within this region though decided not to disobey their faith. Throughout the centuries, strict Muslims saw (and still see) tattooing as being highly disrespectful and unholy. This is because the practice is seen as causing injury to the body, which would be seen as graffiti on a gift from god.

However, early 20th-century documentation suggests that there was still a sizable traditional tattoo culture throughout recent history in parts of North Africa, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt.
